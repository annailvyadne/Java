# Java
This repository contains all solved problems I found in different sources, whether it came from the internet or in books. These problems helped me to hone my technical, programming, and logical thinking skills by using Java as my programming language. I usually use Eclipse IDE, Apache Netbeans, IntelliJ IDEA, and Visual Studio code.
